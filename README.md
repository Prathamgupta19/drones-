This project focuses on the development of an Object Detection Autonomous Drone, designed for autonomous flight control with the integration of real-time object detection capabilities. The drone is built using ArduPilot for flight control and Robot Operating System (ROS) for managing communications and sensor integration. The object detection is enabled by YOLO (You Only Look Once), a powerful real-time detection algorithm, allowing the drone to autonomously identify, track, and navigate around objects during flight.

Key Features:
Autonomous Flight Control: Using ArduPilot for stable flight, navigation, and landing.
Real-Time Object Detection: Integration of YOLO for object detection during flight to identify and track objects.
Autonomous Navigation: The drone can navigate based on object detection and environmental inputs.
Autonomous Takeoff and Landing: Fully automated takeoff, navigation, and landing without the need for manual intervention.
Versatility: Capable of operating in diverse applications such as surveillance, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring.
